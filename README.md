# Unauthorized Construction Detection System

This project focuses on detecting **unauthorized construction activities** by comparing **before and after images** of a location using computer vision techniques.  
It is developed as a **final-year engineering project** with real-world relevance in **urban planning, smart cities, and government monitoring systems**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Unauthorized construction is a major issue in urban areas, leading to:
- Illegal land usage
- Safety risks
- Poor city planning
- Environmental damage  

Manual inspection is inefficient and time-consuming.  
This project aims to **automate construction monitoring** using image comparison techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect construction changes using **before & after images**
- Identify possible **unauthorized constructions**
- Provide a **web-based interface** for monitoring
- Reduce dependency on manual inspections

---

## 🧠 System Approach
1. Upload **before-construction image**
2. Upload **after-construction image**
3. Apply image processing techniques
4. Detect and highlight construction changes
5. Display results on the web interface

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** Flask  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** Python  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
